  That is one thing that traveling does, I think. It wakes us up and allows us
  to really feel things again. It takes us away from the day-to-day that
  sometimes starves us of our true emotion - of joy and wonder and love, and the
  power of these things inside of us. It is so easy to get caught up, and then
  to feel that we are moving through life feeling nothing. "Same shit, different
  day." Wandering across this world we understand again that we aren’t empty,
  but filled with life. I think that within all of us lies a desire to truly
  feel the power that we each have, and I’m realizing that it can only be found
  in the spectrum of emotions that we have been given to use as tools in this
  life. Perhaps this is why we read sad books and see scary movies. Why we ride
  thrill rides and watch romance films. But, there is something incredible to be
  found in exploring this world and finding these things for one's self. For it
  is so much more potent to be the hero of one's own story, rather than the
  voyeur of another’s. And that is what I’m realizing. If this is my story, then
  I don’t want to play a minor role. I don’t want to be a passerby or an extra.
  I want to feel! To laugh and to cry. To fall in love and to write a novel. To
  take on adventure with an open heart, craving interactions and experiences
  like the ones that I have had over the past few days. I want to be the hero of
  my own story. Even if it ends in tragedy, at least I stood up. At least I took
  on the monsters of this world and fought to the end. At least I learned who I
  was, and tried to express the tumultuous nature of my beautifully flawed
  existence. For, even as small as I am, I choose to live a big life, without
  apology. I will not be supporting character. If I have been blessed with the
  power to define this life on my own terms, then I will do so as the
  protagonist in this dramatic, painful, treacherous, incredibly beautiful
  world. And I feel so happy to have been given such an extraordinary setting
  for my story. What a world. I couldn't ask for more.
